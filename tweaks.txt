Nemo file manager:

Install Nemo

The default file manager, GNOME Files, is sufficient for some...but others may find it sorely lacking in features. Instead of giving GNOME Files a chance, why not just install a far more powerful and tweak-able file manager. For this, you’ll want to install Nemo. Here’s how:

Open up a terminal window

Add the requisite repository with the command sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/nemo

Update apt with the command sudo apt-get update

Install Nemo and the file-roller plugin with the command sudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller

Now, there’s a slight problem with using Nemo as it stands. When you issue the command nemo to start the file manager, it will attempt to manage your desktop (which you do not want, considering the Elementary OS Freya desktop cannot work with a third-party manager). To avoid that, issue the command nemo --no-desktop.

But what if you don’t want to start the new file manager from command line? The best way around that is to create a keyboard shortcut. Here’s how:

Open up Settings

Click on Keyboard

Click on Custom

Click the + button

Type the command nemo --no-desktop when prompted to enter the command

Hit the Enter key

Click where it says “Disabled” (Figure 3)

Click the keyboard shortcut you want to use (I prefer Super+F) to assign the key combination

Log out of Elementary OS and log back in for the changes to take effect

How to install elementaryPlus

There1s a eprfect installation guide at elementaryPlus’ Github page, so I just copy it here.

You can add our PPA (Personal Package Archive) to your sources:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cybre/elementaryplus
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install elementaryplus
or just download or clone this repository.

To enable the theme, launch “elementary+ Configurator” from the application menu or run./install.sh from the parent directory of this repository, respectively, and switch on the “Core Icon Theme” option.

Please also make sure, that the original elementary icon theme is installed, because elementary+ only provides additions and inherits the base theme.
